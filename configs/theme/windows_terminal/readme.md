# themes
Some themes that will convert into most terminals
> Contessa has supporting VSCode and Rider themes

+ Salmonal - non-harsh colors  with a Salmon red [my default]
+ Fleet - based on the colors in Jetbrains fleet
+ Pallidus - blue with pale color pallette
+ ContessaCode - does not respect default 16 color pallette ( but is nice in helix editor with base16_terminal theme ) and matches the scheme I made for both VSCode and Rider
